Issues
======
 - When reporting an issue, provide a [jsfiddle](http://www.jsfiddle.net) example (or something like it, such as codepen) which reproduces your problem.
 - Always state the following key points:
   - What were you trying to accomplish? (Infinite scroll, subscribe to click events, ...)
   - What steps did you take? (Use Ink.Dom.Element.inViewport, try to capture the `domready` event, ...)
   - What results did you expect, instead of what you see now?
   - What version of Ink are you using?
